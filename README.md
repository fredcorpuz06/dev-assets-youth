This is an analysis of the external factors - intensity of familial support, safety of neighborhoods, presence of youth programs, etc. - that impact the development of youth in order to generate hypotheses on which factors make the most positive impact.

*The research question is:* How do the presence of developmental assets provided for youth by the community affect youth outcomes in Middlefield and Deep River?
